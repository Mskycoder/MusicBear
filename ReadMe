What's currently missing is the database. The labels of the graph are generated by 'getPastWeek' in 'helpers.js' in the
client folder and the format is DD/MM. The expected data is an array of seven numbers, representing the number of
current listeners to the specified artist. In 'server.js', the database should be able to store hundreds of artists
and append the listener number on a daily basis. A GET request to '/api/artistlist' should return a json array of
all stored artists' names. The hashcode algorithm should remain untouched. The database should be able to save a copy
of each users' username and password(hashed x2) through the POST request at '/api/users'. The password is hashed once
when sent to the server, and hashed a second time when store in the database (username should also be hashed probably).
Server response should include at least a JSON object with attribute 'error' with '0' meaning that there are no errors
and '1' meaning that the use. The GET request at '/api/users' is to check if the username and password pair matches.
The full response of a GET request to '/api/artists/' should include a JSON object with attributes 'name', which
should follow the Last.fm Web API convention: every character is lowercase and spaces are replace by '+', a plus sign,
and it should contain the attribute 'listeners', which should be an array of the number of listeners to the specified
artist the past 7 days (excluding the current day).

TODO:

- Add labels to graphs
- Make monDB run
- Fix search empty
- Hash username
- Fix API (page query)

To run the server/client/both, refer to the package.json in the server folder.
'npm run server', 'npm run client', 'npm run dev', respectively
